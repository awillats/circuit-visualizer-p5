# circuit-visualizer-p5

the force distribution piece of this is a mess

may want links to have forces act on them in future

could add "angular attractors", i.e. attract individual nodes to an angle from the center, for default ordering of nodes

will connect "reachability" highlighting to matrix view


------------

have simple circuit generation lay nodes out in a static ring

should one unified representation be managed (i.e. adjMat?)
or should the graph and adjmat simply be synced?

-----

Completed Features:
- can import connections from binary string (check order / convention)
- can bitshift to "rotate connections"
Feature requests:

- [ ] delete edges / nodes gracefully
- [~] visualize self-connection with loop arrow
    - using circle around node for now
